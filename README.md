# Applied-Math-Project

This repository holds my [project](https://github.com/LucasHasting/Applied-Math-Project/blob/main/Community_Acquired_Pneumonia.pdf) for my Applied Mathematics class. The project included creating and analyzing a model based on community acquired pneumonia in a high risk community.

The project also includes a [matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/install-products-with-internet-connection.html) script that simulates the disease which can be found in the [LaTeX zip file](https://github.com/LucasHasting/Applied-Math-Project/blob/main/Community-Acquired%20Pneumonia.zip).

A [presentation](https://github.com/LucasHasting/Applied-Math-Project/blob/main/Community_Acquired_Pneumonia_Presentation.pdf) was also made for the project and it's [LaTeX zip file](https://github.com/LucasHasting/Applied-Math-Project/blob/main/Community-Acquired%20Pneumonia%20Presentation.zip) is also included.
